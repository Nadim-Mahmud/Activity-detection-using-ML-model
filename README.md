# Activity Detection Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms to detect activity from time series data captured from different sensores. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms and visualize the results effectively as a part of ML class project.

## Data Parsing
To ensure the data is properly parsed, we use the following steps:
1. Load the dataset from the specified files.
2. Clean and preprocess the data.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

## Results Visualization
The results of the algorithms are visualized using various plots:
- **Accuracy Plot**: Shows the accuracy of each algorithm.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of the performance of classification algorithms.
- **ROC Curve**: Illustrates the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Shows the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Execute the main script to train the models and generate the visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive comparison of different machine learning algorithms and their performance on the given dataset. The visualizations help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
